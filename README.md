Prediction of bike share traffic between stations with a step time of one hour
As a basic operational index, the short-term prediction of bike traffic flow plays a vital role in demand forecasting and rebalancing the resources of bike-sharing networks. A number of different methods have been proposed for forecasting bike traffic in recent years, but due to their high performance, deep learning (DL)-based models have dominated this area. With an hourly time step, this project predicts the number of trips between stations.
